## Abstract:

The study has three major purposes: to define the Quantum Mechanics and the 2-dimensional
Conformal Field Theory, to derive the entanglement entropy for a given set of systems
in the frame of the 2-dimensional Conformal Field Theory and show its application to
1-dimensional statistical systems considering an example of quantum XX model.

In the first chapter of the work there is given a background of historical and current
researches treating the entanglement. In the second chapter there is given an introduction
to the Quantum Mechanics with an emphasis on quantum entanglement, next the picture is
generalised to the Quantum Field Theory formalism. The third chapter defines the Conformal
Field Theory with a special considerations of a 2-dimensional case is defined. The fourth
chapter shows methods of deriving the entanglement entropy in the frame of 2-dimensional
Conformal Field Theory for three cases: an interval at zero temperature, an interval at nonzero
temperature and an interval on a circle at zero temperature. In the fifth chapter there is
considered the quantum 1-dimensional XX model as an example of 1-dimensional statistical
systems. Its ground state is derived what enables one to calculate the entanglement entropy
in such a system and show that at its critical point it agrees with the theoretical prediction.

The thesis shows entanglement entropy in a perspective of the 2-dimensional Conformal
Field Theory and that is applicable to 1-dimensional statistical models at their critical point.
